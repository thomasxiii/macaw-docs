      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="intro">Welcome to the <a href="http://macaw.co">Macaw</a> documentation. This is a work in progress and will be continuously updated. Pull requests are welcome so if you would like to contribute, please <a href="https://github.com/macawco/docs">fork me on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h2>What is Macaw</h2>
      <p>Macaw is a professional web design tool built for both designers and developers. It was built with the goal to change how we design for the web. No longer should we need to create static deliverables and write code from scratch to bring them to life. With Macaw, you can create responsive web designs using the web as your medium. Its fluid interface is similar to image editing software so getting up and running is simple. It also boasts one of the smartest design to code engines ever built, which analyzes your design to generate smart, succinct code with the click of a button.</p>

      <h2>What Macaw is Not</h2>
      <p>Macaw is not a Content Management System. It also does not handle server side technologies. It was developed to create wireframes, prototypes and mock-ups rapidly and to provide the static HTML, CSS and JavaScript needed to quickly get your designs on the web.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="drawing">
      <h1>Drawing</h1>
      <p>The primary way of creating elements in Macaw is drawing. Macaw allows you to draw numerous types of elements by simply <strong>clicking and dragging</strong> on the canvas.</p>

      <h3>Units</h3>
      <p>You can draw elements with percentage or pixel based widths and positions. The controls for these options appear in the property bar after selecting a drawing tool.</p>
      <img src="images/percentage-or-px-based-width-and-x.png" alt="">

      <h3>Snap</h3>
      <p>You can toggle Snap by selecting <strong class="cmd">View > Toggle Snap</strong> or pressing <strong class="key osx">Cmd+U</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+U</strong>. When enabled, your cursor will snap to the grid, canvas boundaries and other elements as you draw.</p>
      <img src="images/drawing-snapping.gif" alt="">

      <h3>Drag Origin</h3>
      <p>When drawing an element, hold <strong class="key osx">Option</strong> <strong class="key win">Alt</strong> to change the element's origin instead of its size.</p>

      <h2>Element Tool (R)</h2>
      <p>The Element Tool is the most primitive of the drawing tools. It creates empty elements with no content. They can be useful for rapid prototyping or initial styling. However, it's recommended that these elements eventually be converted into containers.</p>

      <h2>Container Tool (G)</h2>
      <p>Containers are used for grouping elements. However, containers are not like groups in standard image editing software. They have their own dimensions and can be styled like other elements.</p>

      <p>To create a container using the Container Tool, simple click and drag on the canvas. As the area of the container expands, it will highlight any elements it covers. Highlighted elements will be placed inside the newly drawn container.</p>

      <p>You can also create containers by selecting an array of elements and using the <strong class="cmd">Elements > Group</strong> command or <strong class="key osx">Cmd+G</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+G</strong>. Groups created in this way will automatically set the group dimensions to fit the boundaries of the children.</p>

      <p>Note: If the bottommost element being grouped surrounds all of the other elements, Macaw will ask if you would like to transfer presentation attributes to the new container. This will place all other selected elements inside the larger element. It is highly recommended that you do so as it typically results in cleaner and more semantic markup.</p>
      <img src="images/transfering-presentation-attributes.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Text Tool (T)</h2>

      <p>Macaw's canvas is actually a web browser, so it renders text exactly how it will appear on the web. It can also tie in to popular font services like Typekit.</p>

      <h3>Paragraph and Point Text</h3>
      <p>There are two types of text elements in Macaw: point text and paragraph text. Simply clicking on the canvas with the Text Tool, will create a Point Text field that has auto width and behaves like an inline element. Paragraph Text, which has set dimensions and behaves like a block level element, can be created by clicking and dragging on the canvas with the Text Tool.</p>

      <p>You can toggle between the two types of text boxes, by changing the element's width suffix in the Dimensions Palette. Choosing <strong>Auto</strong> will set the element to Point Text, whereas <strong>px</strong> or <strong>%</strong> will set the element to Paragraph Text.</p>

      <h3>Dimensions</h3>
      <p>When a text element is selected, resize handles help you identify it's type and properties. If side handles are present, they indicate that an element's width is set in px or %. Top and bottom handles indicate that this text element has a height set in px or %. Lack of handles show that width or height is set to auto.</p>
      <img src="images/text-selection-boxes.png" alt="">

      <h3>Paragraphs versus line breaks</h3>
      <p>Hitting <strong class="key">Return</strong> to separate lines of text inside a text box will result in code output for that box being divided into several paragraphs. You can also use <strong class="key">Shift+Return</strong> to create line breaks (&lt;br&gt;) in the code output.</p>

      <h3>Lorem Insertion</h3>
      <p>Macaw supports <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> text generation, for quickly filling text elements with dummy text. Simply type <strong class="key">loremXY</strong> and press <strong class="key">TAB</strong>. In this shortcut, Y must be set to either 'w' for words, 's' for sentences or 'p' for paragraphs. X must be an integer indicating the number of Y to insert. For example, <strong class="key">lorem3p</strong> would insert three paragraphs and <strong class="key">lorem2s</strong> would insert two sentences.</p>
      <img src="images/lorem-generator.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Input Tool (N)</h2>
      <p>Text, email, password, number, search and URL input elements can all be drawn using the Input Tool. By default, Macaw will draw a standard text input. To change the input type before drawing, click and hold on the input tool icon to reveal a sub-menu of input types. You can change and existing input type using the Type drop-down in the inspector. Note: changing the input type is not immediately noticeable within Macaw. However, the type attribute will be set when published.</p>
      <p>Input fields are text editable. Any text you put inside the element will be used as placeholder text when published.</p>

      <h2>Button Tool (B)</h2>
      <p>Buttons are similar to text elements, but they automatically center their text vertically. They also have a special property called "type" (editable in the advanced palette) which allows them to handle things like form submission.</p>
      <p>Note: if using a button for a simple link, you may want to convert the button to an "a" tag (anchor element). This can be done by renaming the element (<strong class="key osx">Cmd+R</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+R</strong>) to "a.button-name". This may cause some unwanted style changes, but will create a more standards-adherent link.</p>

      <h2>Textarea (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>Textarea elements are much like input elements, but they allow for larger working areas. The textarea's name attribute and resize setting can be set in the inspector.</p>

      <h2>Select (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>The select element is basically a drop-down list. You can modify the available options for the select using the list builder in the Inspector. You can add an option by clicking the <strong class="btn">+</strong> button. Double-clicking the option name allows you to edit the text. Click and drag an option to rearrange it and click the trash icon to delete it. Note: the first option will be used as the default.</p>
      <img src="images/select-options.gif" alt="">

      <h2>Checkbox &amp; Radio (Shift-N)</h2>
      <p>Checkbox and radio elements can be drawn by clicking and dragging on the canvas with their respective tools. Both elements have a minimum width of 66 px and minimum height of 22 px, that are applied when drawing, but can be adjusted later.</p>
      <p>When a checkbox or radio element is added to the canvas, three elements are actually created: a checkbox or radio, a label and a container for them both.</p>
      <img src="images/radio-checkbox-structure.gif" alt="">
    </section>

    <section id="positioning">
      <h1>Positioning</h1>

      <p>Macaw allows three types of positioning: static (default), absolute and fixed. Each of these mechanisms has its own uses and limitations. Every element within Macaw can have its own type of positioning.</p>

      <p>Positioning modes can be set using the three icons on the left of the property bar, which are visible when an element is selected. The wave icon is used for static, the crosshair is for absolute and the pin is for fixed positioning.</p>

      <h2>Static</h2>
      <p>Static is the default positioning mode of Macaw. Elements set to static are positioned in relation to the element that precedes it in the document. This can be somewhat confusing to someone unfamiliar with web development, however it's very important to learn the concept of static positioning as most of the web is constructed using these mechanics.</p>

      <p>Margins are the properties used to set the distance between an element and the one before it. When dragging an element around the canvas, Macaw will automatically calculate the margins necessary to position the element. You can also use the margin controls in the property bar for fine-tuning.</p>

      <p>Static positioned elements have a blue outline.</p>

      <p>Note: Elements using static positioning are essentially chained together. Therefore, modifying properties of one element may affect the positioning of other elements.</p>

      <img src="images/position-static.png" alt="Static Position">

      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>Absolute positioning allows elements to be placed at a specific coordinate, which is relative to its parent's coordinates. Elements set to absolute are not in the document flow and, therefore, do not affect the position of the elements around it.</p>

      <p>Absolute positioned elements have an orange outline.</p>

      <img src="images/position-absolute.png" alt="Absolute Position">

      <h2>Fixed</h2>
      <p>Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning except that the coordinates set for fixed elements are relative to the viewport instead of the element's parent. So, elements with fixed positioning will stay in place as the document is scrolled.</p>

      <p>Fixed positioned elements have a green outline.</p>

      <img src="images/position-fixed.png" alt="Fixed Position">

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Origins define the direction in which an element is positioned. The options translate to different properties based on the positioning mode.</p>

      <p>Elements with static positioning allow x-origins to be changed to left, right or center. Left origins will use margin-left to position an element. Right origins will float an element to the right and utilize margin-right for positioning. Center origins will force an element to center using <code>auto</code> for <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code>.</p>

      <p>Elements with absolute or fixed positioning have x and y origin controls. Left and right x-origins will publish as left and right properties. Center x-origins will publish as <code>left: 0; right: 0; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto;</code>. Y-origins will use top and bottom properties and center y-origins will publish as <code>top: 0; bottom: 0; margin-top: auto; margin-bottom: auto;</code>.</p>

      <h2>Guides</h2>
      <p>Macaw provides on-canvas positioning guides to help you position an element precisely how you want it. Positioning guides appear when dragging an element around the canvas when its edges align with another element or the grid.</p>

      <p>If guides do not appear, they may have been toggled off. They can be toggled back on using <strong class="cmd">View > Toggle Positioning Guides</strong> or <strong class="key osx">Cmd+'</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+'</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Margins</h2>
      <p>Margin indicators (solid semi-transparent blocks that show up on element's sides when it's selected) help to determine how an element will be placed on the canvas with relation to the surrounding elements. Indicators change color to identify the positioning mode used: blue is for static, orange is for absolute and green is for fixed.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Top position/margin can only be set in pixel values.</p>

      <h2>Padding</h2>
      <p>Padding can be applied to all elements except for empty elements and empty containers. Once a standard element becomes a container (with child elements of any type), it gains the ability to have its paddings set.</p>

      <p>Padding is set inside the Dimensions section of the Inspector Pane and is symbolized by an interactive map of padding properties (all paddings, top, left, bottom and right). A value field next to the padding map shows padding value for the currently selected property. Apart from setting individual paddings, or applying the padding to all side with the center most icon, holding shift and clicking on different padding properties allows for setting multiple paddings at the same time (e.g. top and bottom).</p>

    <section id="properties">
      <h1>Styling/Properties</h1>
      <p>Macaw allows you to apply various styles to your elements using the Inspector Pane. To set an element's styles, select it and pick choose the desired styles from the Inspector. Some styles can be applied to multiple elements at once. Hold <strong class="key">SHIFT</strong> to select multiple elements for styling.</p>

      <p>Some elements have default styles applied:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Element</strong> - elements have their background color set to gray: rgb(222, 222, 222).</li>
        <li><strong>Text</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Paragraph spacing is set to 1em.</li>
        <li><strong>Button</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background color set to rgb(222, 222, 222), with a border radius of 3px.</li>
        <li><strong>Input</strong> - font is set to black 13px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with left and right paddings set to 10px.</li>
        <li><strong>Text area</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with all paddings set to 5px and a 1px gray rgb(119, 119, 119) border.</li>
        <li><strong>Select</strong> - font is set to black 13px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400. Background is set to a lighter gray rgb(242, 242, 242), with left padding set to 10px, a 1px gray rgb(119, 119, 119) border and a border radius of 3px. Additionally this element has a SVG background (select-arrows.svg).</li>
        <li><strong>Checkbox and Radio Button</strong> - font is set to black 16px Helvetica with 1.38em line height and a weight of 400.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Borders and Border Radius</h2>
      <p>Border and border radius can be set on all elements except images. Images require that you wrap the image in a container and apply the border properties to the containing element.</p>

      <h3>Adding/Editing Borders</h3>
      <p>Borders can be applied to an element using the border palette. Select the sides you wish to apply borders to using the selector on the left side of the palette. You can select the center selector to add a border to all sides or you can select one or more of the top, right, bottom and left selectors by holding <strong class="key">Shift</strong> while you select them. Once you select the sides you can specify border width, style and color. Each setting can be set separately per side.</p>
      <img src="images/borders-default.png" class="img-borders-default" />

      <p>Example of an element with borders on all sides.</p>
      <img src="images/borders-all-sides.png" class="img-borders-all-sides" />

      <p>Example of an element with the same border styles only applied to the top and left.</p>
      <img src="images/borders-two-sides.png" class="img-borders-two-sides" />

      <p>Example of an element with different border styles on the top and left.</p>
      <img src="images/borders-specific.png" class="img-borders-specific" />

      <p>Using the side selectors you can toggle to the different sides to see/edit that border.</p>

      <h3>Adjusting Border Radius</h3>
      <p>The border radius palette works very similar to the borders palette. You can select different sides using the selectors on the left side of the palette. Once you select the sides you want to set the border radius on type in or change the value in the input to set the border radius. Just like the borders palette you can select multiple sides at a time by holding <strong class="key">Shift</strong> while you select sides.</p>
      <img src="images/border-radius.png" class="img-borders-radius" />

      <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows for setting background colors, images and even setting a gradient background. One element can have multiple background images/gradients applied, that can be managed inside the Backgrounds section of Inspector pane. Backgrounds can also be changed per breakpoint.</p>

      <h3>Background Color</h3>
      <p>Background color can be set through the Background Color value field. Supported values are HEX, RGB and HSL. You can also use the keyword 'transparent', which will convert to rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) (the same will happen if the value is deleted). Macaw also supports semi-transparent background colors, which can be entered as RGBA and HSLA.</p>
      <img src="images/background-color-field.png" class="img-background-color-field" />

      <p>Background colors can be also chosen through the Color Picker dialog, by clicking on the color well near the background color value field. This will launch Macaw's Color Picker in which you can adjust the color and set transparency as well as the color's format.</p>

      <img src="images/color-picker-dialog.gif" class="img-color-picker-dialog" />

      <h3>Background Images and Gradients</h3>

      <h4>Adding</h4>
      <p>To add a background, click the <strong class="btn">+</strong> button in the Backgrounds Palette and select the type of background you wish to add.</p>

      <h4>Deleting</h4>
      <p>To delete a background click on the trashcan button or right-click on the background and select <strong class="cmd">Delete</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Ordering</h4>
      <p>The background palette allows for dragging and dropping of backgrounds to set the order that they will render in your element.</p>

      <h4>Editing</h4>
      <p>To edit a background, double click on the background you wish to edit in the inspector or right-click and select <strong class="cmd">Edit</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Toggling Visibility</h4>
      <p>Individual backgrounds can be toggled on/off using the eye icon. If a background is toggled off, it will not be added to the element both in Macaw and on publish. Visibility can be set per breakpoint.</p>

      <h4>Selecting Background Images</h4>
      <p>Within the image background dialog you can select to import a new image to use for your background or you can pick an existing image from your library. Background images can be scaled for retina using the <strong class="btn">@2x</strong> button.</p>

      <h2>Shadows</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add drop, inner and text shadows to elements on the canvas. Multiple shadows can be added to a single element and shadows can be changed per breakpoint.</p>

      <h3>Adding</h3>
      <p>To add a shadow, click the <strong class="btn">+</strong> button in the Shadows Palette and select the type of shadow you wish to add.</p>

      <h3>Deleting</h3>
      <p>To delete a shadow click on the trashcan button or right-click on the shadow and select <strong class="cmd">Delete</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Ordering</h3>
      <p>The shadow palette allows for dragging and dropping of shadows to set the order that they will render on your elements.</p>

      <h3>Editing</h3>
      <p>To edit a shadow, double click on the shadow you wish to edit in the inspector or right-click and select <strong class="cmd">Edit</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Toggling Visibility</h3>
      <p>Individual shadows can be toggled on/off using the eye (icon) for a shadow. If a shadow is toggled off it will not be added to the element both in Macaw and on publish. Visibility can be set per breakpoint.</p>

      <h2>Links</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add links to any element in your design. You can easily link to another page in your project or you can type in a URL.</p>

      <p>It is recommended that links only be added to "a" tags, which results in the appropriate HREF attribute when published. However, you can add links to any element. Macaw will use ugly JavaScript onclick events to handle these types of links.</p>

      <h3>Linking to Pages</h3>
      <p>To have an element link to another page in your project you can use the "Page Menu" in the link palette to select the page you want to link to.</p>
      <img src="images/links-pages.png" class="img-links-pages">

      <h3>Linking to External Pages</h3>
      <p>You can add an external link to any element by typing in the URL you want to element to link to.</p>
      <img src="images/links-external.png" class="img-links-external">

    </section>

    <section id="display">
      <h1>Display</h1>
      <p>Macaw allows you to toggle how elements are displayed both in the editor and on publish. This setting allows you to hide elements in Macaw to aid with designing your pages and set elements to display none on publish. The latter helps to create hidden menus, etc.

      <p>Display can be set by using the display toggle buttons in the inspector or via the element's layer in the outline. There are three states of visibility for all elements. These states are:</p>

      <h2>Display States</h2>
      <div class="button-list">
        <p><img src="images/display-visible.png" class="img-display-visible"> <strong class="key">Visible</strong> The element is visible in both Macaw and in the published files.</p>
        <p><img src="images/display-invisible.png" class="img-display-invisible"> <strong class="key">Invisible</strong> The element is hidden in Macaw but is still displayed on publish.</p>
        <p><img src="images/display-none.png" class="img-display-none"> <strong class="key">None</strong> The element is invisible in both Macaw and in the published files.</p>
      </div>
      <p>NOTE: While the element is display none it will not be selectable.</p>


      <h2>Inspector</h2>
      <p>The display toggle tools in the inspector are located to the right of the element name, id and variable fields. The item highlighted in blue indicates the element's current display state. Clicking on any of the display buttons will update the selected elements display setting.</p>
      <img src="images/display-inspector.png" class="img-display-inspector">

      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <p>The display toggle in the outline is located on the left side of the element's layer and is indicated by an "eye" icon or a dot icon if set to display none. Clicking on the "eye" icon will toggle the element's display between "visible" and "invisible". <strong class="key osx">⌘+Click</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+Click</strong> will toggle it's display between "visible" and "none".</p>
      <img src="images/display-outline.png" class="img-display-outline">
    </section>

    <section id="text">
      <h1>Text</h1>

      <h2>Styling Text</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to set a variety of properties on your text elements using the Typography palette. The order of the properties in the palette from left to right, top to bottom are: font family, font weight, font size, line height, color, italic, uppercase, underline, letter spacing, word spacing, text indent, paragraph spacing and text alignment.</p>
      <img src="images/text-styling.png" class="img-text-styling">

      <h2>Type Stats</h2>
      <p>Macaw provides more advanced stats for each of your text elements to help you find the right text styles for your design. Located in the bottom right of the Typography palette, Macaw provides calculated values for total characters and average characters per line.</p>
      <img src="images/text-type-stats.png" class="img-text-type-stats">

    </section>
    <section id="rich-text">
      <h1>Rich Text Editing</h1>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add inline styles to text inside your text elements. This is done by applying styles to a tag or node within your text. Each text element can contain its own styles for each node that will be globally applied to all like nodes within that text element. Rich text styles are also responsive and can have styles per state.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Currently Macaw only allows for the creation of nodes one level deep restricting the creation of nodes within nodes.</p>

      <h2>Available Tags/Nodes</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add nodes with tags of span, a, em and strong. All tags have been stripped of their default styling to allow for the most customization.</p>

      <h2>Creating Rich Text Node</h2> 
      <p>You can do this by doing the following:</p>

      <img src="images/rich-text-create-node.png" class="img-rich-text-create-node">

      <p>1. Begin by going into edit mode for your text.</p>
      <p>2. Select the text that you want to style.</p>
      <p>3. Using the inspector panel on the right select the tag you wish to wrap your selection.</p>
      <p>4. Style the new node using the palettes on the right.</p>

      <img src="images/rich-text-style-node.png" class="img-rich-text-style-node">

      <h2>Selecting Nodes</h2>
      <p>When a text element contains nodes you can select an entire node's contents by double clicking on any of the text inside it or by placing your cursor anywhere in it's text. In addition if a selection is made that partially contains a node the selection will be updated to either contain just the node OR to contain the text without the node. This is to ensure that the code inside your text element is as clean as possible.</p>

      <h2>Styling Text Nodes</h2>
      <p>Styling text nodes within text elements is as easy as placing your cursor anywhere inside the node OR selecting the entire nodes contents (double click anywhere within the node's text). Once a node is selected you can use the palettes on the right to style the node.</p>

      <h2>Shared Styles</h2>
      <p>All nodes that share the same tag will share styles within each text element. This just means that if you create a blue link in the text all anchors in that text element will be blue. In the event you update that link to be red all anchors within the text will be updated as well. This is to allow you to edit styles quickly across entire text elements.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>

      
      <img src="images/rich-text-shared-styles1.png" class="img-rich-text-shared-styles">
      <p>Initial styles for spans within the text.</p>

      <img src="images/rich-text-shared-styles2.png" class="img-rich-text-shared-styles">
      <p>After changing color and text decoration for a single span all other spans were updated.</p>

      <h2>Copying Rich Text Styles</h2>
      <p>In the event you have two text elements that should contain the same rich text styles you can use the "Copy Visual Attributes" command to copy both the element's styles and all its rich text node styles over to the other element.</p>

      <h2>Changing a Node's Tag</h2>
      <p>An existing nodes tag can be changed at any time by selecting the node and using the tag buttons at the top of the inspector. On change of the tag if any existing styles exist for the new tag they will be applied to the node.</p>

      <h2>Deleting a Node</h2>
      <p>Nodes can be removed by first selecting the tag and clicking the "No Tag" button located in the inspector.</p>

      <h1>Fonts</h1>
      <p>Macaw provides a list of browser-safe fonts and a curated list of Google Web Fonts. However, you can add Typekit fonts and even enable System Fonts.</p>
      <p>Each available font in the font family drop-down is labeled with a different icon displaying what font type. Font types depicted in the image below are: Typekit, Google Fonts, System, and Universal.</p>
      <img src="images/fonts-types.png" class="img-fonts-types">

      <h2>Typekit Fonts</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to add Typekit fonts to your project. Currently only one Typekit kit can be added to a project at a time.</p>

      <h3>Adding Typekit Fonts</h3>
      <p>Typekit fonts can be added by doing the following:</p>

      <p>1. Create a Typekit kit containing the fonts you wish to use. This is done on the Typekit website.</p>
      <p>2. Within your kit settings on Typekit add "localhost" to the allowed domains for your kit.</p>
      <p>3. In Macaw open the font family drop-down. A text element will need to be selected to make it visible.</p>
      <p>4. Click the "Add Fonts..." button in the top left of the drop-down.</p>
      <img src="images/fonts-webfonts-add.png" class="img-fonts-webfonts-add">
      <p>5. In the new dialog enter you Typekit kit ID.</p>
      <img src="images/fonts-typekit-kit.png" class="img-fonts-typekit-kit">
      <p>6. Macaw will give you a green mark if the fonts were imported correctly or a red "X" if it failed.</p>
      <p>7. On success your Typekit fonts will be listed in the font list</p>

      <p>IMPORTANT: Sometimes it can take Typekit some time to sync up and add "localhost" to your kit. In the event Macaw keeps saying your kit could not be imported, wait a few minutes and try again.</p>

      <h3>Publishing Typekit Fonts</h3>
      <p>On publish Macaw will analyze your project and in the event it finds that Typekit fonts are used it will be sure to add the necessary Typekit scripts to your files.</p>

      <h2>System Fonts</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to use any system fonts you might have in your design. By default these fonts are hidden in the font family drop-down. To enable them click the "Show System Fonts" button in the upper right corner of the font drop-down.</p>
      <p>NOTE: System fonts will only work when editing and viewing your design locally. They will not work when uploaded to a server unless the necessary steps are taken.</p>
      <img src="images/fonts-system-fonts.png" class="img-fonts-system-fonts">
    </section>

    <section id="images">
      <h1>Images</h1>

      <h2>Adding Images</h2>
      <p>Images can be added to your project in three ways. Import to library, import to canvas and dragging images into Macaw.</p>

      <h3>Import to Library</h3>
      <p>Importing images to your library allows you to move images into your Macaw project for later use. Once images are imported into your library you can drag them onto the canvas.</p>
      <p>To import images to your library you can go to <strong class="cmd">File > Import to Library</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key osx">Shift+⌘+I</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+Shift+I</strong>. Multiple images can be imported simultaneously.</p>

      <h3>Import to Canvas</h3>
      <p>Import to canvas performs the same way as "Import to Library" but in addition to adding all the images to your library they will also be added to the canvas.</p>
      <p>To import to canvas you can go to <strong class="cmd">File > Import to Canvas</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key osx">⌘+I</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+I</strong>. Multiple images can be imported simultaneously.</p>

      <h3>Drag Import</h3>
      <p>Images can also be imported directly to the canvas by dragging files from a folder outside of Macaw onto the canvas. This performs like "Import to Canvas" where all images will be both added to your library and to the current canvas.</p>

      <h2>Scaling Images</h2>
      <p>Images by default will always have a height of "auto" and will preserve their proportions on transform or width change. To change an images width and height independently see "Cropping Images" below.</p>

      <h2>Retina Images</h2>
      <o>Macaw allows for the toggling of images to retina dimensions with a single button click. Any image can be toggled using the <strong class="btn">@2x</strong> button in the images palette.</p>
      <p>Note: On retina enabled devices, images on the canvas and images used for backgrounds will be imported with the <strong class="btn">@2x</strong> enabled by default.</p>
      <img src="images/images-retina.png" class="img-images-retina">

      <h2>Generating Optimized Images</h2>
      <p>Macaw makes available the ability to generate optimized images. On project publish, Macaw will analyze all the images in your project and generate new images based on their dimensions. It will also generate regular and @2x retina images. The benefit of this is to ensure that your finished project will not contain unnecessarily large images. Instead it will have images at exactly the size it needs so that you site will download as quick as possible.</p>

      <p>&quot;Generate Optimized Images&quot; can be enabled in the &quot;Publish Settings&quot; dialog under the &quot;Images&quot; section. To view this window, go to <strong class="cmd">File > Publish Settings</strong> or use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key osx">⌘+SHIFT+P</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+SHIFT+P</strong></p>
      <img src="images/images-generate.png" class="img-images-generate">

      <h2>Cropping Images</h2>
      <p>Macaw allows you to crop individual instances of images. This allows you to dynamically generate differently proportioned images from a single image inside your project. Images can also be cropped per breakpoint.</p>
      <p>Note: To be able to crop images in your project you must enable &quot;Generate Optimized Images&quot; in your project's publish settings under the &quot;Images&quot; section. It can also be enabled by double clicking on an image. Macaw will prompt you and ask if you would like to enable it.</p>

      <h3>Perform Image Crop</h3>
      <p>To begin cropping an image element, double click it on the canvas. This will enter image crop mode and additional transform handles will become available. Within crop mode you can scale the image, move it within its its frame and modify the frame width and height using the frame handles at the top, right, bottom and left sides. Clicking the <strong class="btn">Reset</strong> button in the image palette will undo all cropping applied to an image. See "Resetting Images" below.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Images cannot be resized / scaled to be smaller than the current crop area. To sacle an image when in crop mode, you must first crop the image.</p>

      <h3>Committing Image Crop</h3>
      <p>Once an image has been cropped to the desired dimensions, you can leave image crop mode by double clicking anywhere outside of the image. This will apply the changes that were made and the new updated image will be generated.</p>

      <h3>Cancel Image Crop</h3>
      <p>Anytime during image cropping, all changes can be reverted by hitting <strong class="key">ESC</strong>. This will rollback the image to what it was when image crop started and exit image crop mode.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <p>Image before crop</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-before.png" class="img-images-crop-before">

      <p>Image crop mode enabled.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-start.png" class="img-images-crop-start">

      <p>Image scale, position and frame adjusted.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-edit.png" class="img-images-crop-edit">

      <p>Finished image after crop.</p>
      <img src="images/images-crop-done.png" class="img-images-crop-done">

      <h2>Resetting Images</h2>
      <p>Any images that have been scaled, toggled to retina or cropped can be reset at any time to their original settings using the <strong class="btn">Reset</strong> button in the image palette. This reset will only affect the image's settings at the current breakpoint.</p>
      <img src="images/images-reset.png" class="img-images-reset">

      <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
      <p>By default images can be scaled and toggled to retina per breakpoint. When &quot;Generate Optimized Images&quot; is enabled, images can also be cropped per breakpoint. Each of these topics have been discussed in previous sections. When "Generate Optimized Images" is toggled on Macaw will include the &quot;rimages.js&quot; file with your published project files in the js folder. This library handles the swapping out of images both for retina and across breakpoints. All of the image's settings for this library are applied to the images tag via data attributes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="canvas">
      <h1>Canvas</h1>
      <p>The canvas in Macaw is not a fixed size like in other image editors. It is fluid like a browser window and can be resized at any moment using the resize handle located on the right side of the canvas. This allows you to see how your design behaves at different viewport widths. The height of the canvas is also dynamic. It grows as you add elements to the page – always giving you room to work.</p>

      <h2>Scrolling</h2>
      <p>Horizontal scrolling moves the entire viewport left or right for easier manipulation of elements. Scrolling the canvas vertically, however, scrolls the content of the viewport. This allows you to see the effects of fixed positioning.</p>

      <h2>Hand Tool (H)</h2>
      <p>In addition to scrolling the canvas, you can use the Hand Tool to grab and drag it. When using the Hand Tool, a navigator thumbnail will appear in the upper-right corner of the viewport to show the currently visible area. Click anywhere on the navigator to jump to a section in your document.</p>
      <img src="images/navigator.gif" class="img-navigator">

      <h2>Adding Breakpoints</h2>
      <p>You can click and drag the resize handle on the right side of the canvas to watch your designs flow at different viewport sizes. While dragging, a tooltip will appear above the handle to indicate the current width of the canvas. Pressing <strong class="key osx">Cmd</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl</strong> while dragging allows you to insert a breakpoint at the current width. Breakpoints can also be added using the "+" button in the Breakpoints Palette.</p>

      <h2>Changing Breakpoints</h2>
      <p>You can quickly jump to a viewport size by clicking the appropriate link in the Breakpoints Palette. There are also some useful keyboard shortcuts: <strong class="key osx">Cmd+[</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+[</strong> will move down one breakpoint, <strong class="key osx">Cmd+]</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctr+]</strong> will move up one breakpoint and <strong class="key osx">Cmd+\</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+\</strong> will toggle between the current breakpoint and the default breakpoint.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="grid">
      <h1>The Grid</h1>

      <p>The grid is an essential part of Macaw's workspace and design work flow. It helps place elements evenly on the page and serves as a guide throughout the design process. The Grid Palette allows you to set the grid to match your preferences. Note: grid settings can be changed per breakpoint.</p>

      <h3>Grid Width</h3>
      <p>This sets the width of the entire grid. It can be set in either pixels or percentages to create static or fluid grids.</p>

      <h3>Columns</h3>
      <p>This is the total number of columns in your grid. The widths of the columns will be automatically calculated.</p>

      <h3>Gutter</h3>
      <p>This is the space between grid columns. It is always set in percentages.</p>
      <img src="images/grid-setting-up.gif" alt="">
    </section>

    <section id="components">
      <h1>Components</h1>
      <p>Components are structured groups of elements that can be reused throughout your project. They live in the Library of your project and can be retrieved there on any page.</p>

      <h2>Creating Components</h2>
      <p>To create a component, select the elements that will make up the component and use the command <strong class="cmd">Element > Create Component</strong> or <strong class="key osx">⌘+K</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+K</strong>. You will be asked to name the new component after which the component will become available in your library. You can then create a new instance of the component by dragging it from the library to the canvas.</p>

      <p>Note: The name you enter for the component will be used only for reference within the library. It will not affect the markup in any way.</p>
      <img src="images/components.gif" class="img-components">
    </section>

    <section id="outline">
      <h1>Outline (O)</h1>
      <p>Macaw's Outline panel is much like the layers palette found in other design tools. It shows you all the elements on the current page, how those elements are structured and it also displays the z-index of elements in your document. Elements that are higher in the outline will be displayed on top of elements below it. The outline is not just a visual tool. It can also be used to quickly structure your document, select elements, set element tags/classes (Renaming) and more.</p>

      <p>The Outline can be toggled to using the "Outline" button in the top right corner of the app or using the <strong class="key">O</strong> key.</p>
      <img src="images/outline-view.png" class="img-outline-view">

      <h2>Moving Elements</h2>
      <p>Elements can be moved by selecting the layers you wish to move and dragging them to the desired position. While dragging a blue indicator bar will represent where the elements will be placed. If the indicator bar is inside a container all moving elements will become children of that container.</p>
      <img src="images/outline-move.png" class="img-outline-move">

      <p>While moving elements you can also get a blue indicator box. When this indicator box is displayed it means that the element that is highlighted will become a container and all moving elements will be placed inside it.</p>
      <img src="images/outline-drag-into.png" class="img-outline-drag-into">

      <h2>Expanding/Collapsing Containers</h2>
      <p>Layers for container elements can be expanded/collapsed to display/hide children elements for easier traversal of the outline. Click the arrow icon to expand/collapse layers.</p>

      <h2>Toggle Layer Visibility</h2>
      <p>See the <a href="#display">Display</a> section of the documentation for info on toggle element visibility and display.</p>

      <h2>Locking Layers</h2>
      <p>In some situations you may want to lock layers to make them uneditable. This allows you to edit other parts of your document without having to worry about making unintended changes.</p>
      <p>Layers can be locked/unlocked by clicking the icon to the right of the Visibility icon. When layers are locked the icon will be displayed as a lock. When layers are unlocked the icon will be a dot.</p>

      <h2>Renaming Layers</h2>
      <p>The Outline can be the quickest way to set element tags and classes. To rename anThen you can start typing tags and classes. As you type, a code hint dialog will popup giving you suggestions for tags and classes you have used elsewhere in your document.</p>

      <h2>Outline Pro Tips</h2>
      <p>Here are a few shortcuts/features for using the Outline.</p>

      <h3>Tab Renaming</h3>
      <p>When renaming elements you can quickly jump and rename the element below it by using the <strong class="key">TAB</strong> key. You can jump to the element above it by using <strong class="key">Shift+TAB</strong>. This allows you to quickly rename multiple elements just by using the keyboard.</p>

      <h3>Quickly Move Elements Forward/Backward</h3>
      <p>You can quickly move elements forwards and backwards in the Outline using <strong class="cmd">Edit > Move Backwards</strong> <strong class="key osx">Cmd+[</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+[</strong> or <strong class="cmd">Edit > Move Forwards</strong> <strong class="key osx">Cmd+]</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+]</strong>. When moving an element in this way the element will be moved into containers as it hits them. Any collapsed layers will be skipped.</p>

      <p>You can also move elements to the front or to the back by using <strong class="cmd">Edit > Send to Back</strong> <strong class="key osx">Shift+Cmd+[</strong> <strong class="key win">Shift+Ctrl+[</strong> or  <strong class="cmd">Edit > Send to Front</strong> <strong class="key osx">Shift+Cmd+]</strong> <strong class="key win">Shift+Ctrl+]</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Quickly Scroll Canvas to Element</h3>
      <p>You can quickly scroll the canvas to a specific element using the Outline. This can be done by clicking the icon next to the element's name.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="global-styles">
      <h1>Global Styles</h1>
      <p>Global styles are a defined set of properties that can be applied to multiple elements at a time. A single element can also have multiple styles applied to it. Any change to a global style will automatically update all elements that haven't overwritten that property.</p>

      <p>Global styles are managed via the "Quick Styles" tool which is located in the bottom left corner of the main application window.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles.png" class="img-quick-styles">

      <p>When a project has global styles, all available styles will be listed in the Quick Styles tool. Any applied styles (assuming there are elements selected) will be at the top with a dark gray background. All other styles will be listed below.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-display.png" class="img-quick-styles-display">

      <h2>Creating a Global Style</h2>
      <p>To create a global style open the Quick Styles tool and click the gray <strong class="btn">+</strong> button. The style dialog will open. Inside the style dialog you can set the style's name, see how many elements it is applied to and edit it's properties. By default all properties are toggled off and grayed out. To add properties to the style click the circle next to each property. Once toggled on, property inputs will become enabled.</p>
      <img src="images/global-style-property.png" class="img-global-style-property">

      <h2>Creating a Global Style from an Element</h2>
      <p>Global styles can be created from an existing element in your project. To do this, select the element on the canvas and then click the gray <strong class="btn">+</strong> button in the Quick Styles tool. When you create a style from an element the style will be pre-populated with all the visual properties of that element. Properties can still be toggled on/off.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: When a global style is created from an element the style will be automatically applied to the originating element.</strong></p>

      <h2>Deleting a Global Style</h2>
      <p>To delete a global style open the Quick Styles tool and right click on the style you wish to delete and click "Delete Style". This will delete the style and break all element references it has.<p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-delete.png" class="img-quick-styles-delete">

      <h2>Applying Styles to Elements</h2>
      <p>To add a style to an element select the elements you want to add the style to and click the <strong class="btn">+</strong> icon to the left of the style name in the Quick Styles tool.</p>
      <p>When a style is added it will apply all of the properties that make up that style to the element. Overwriting any values that the elements have.</p>

      <h2>Removing Styles from Elements</h2>
      <p>To remove a style, select the elements you want to remove the style from and click the styles corresponding <strong class="btn">&times;</strong> button. This will break the link between the style and elements.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: When a style is removed from an element only the reference between the style and the element is removed. The element's visual properties will stay exactly the same.</strong></p>

      <h2>Modifying Styles</h2>
      <p>To modify a style open the Quick Styles Tool and double click on the style you wish to update. The style dialog will open and you will be able to make changes to that style.</p>
      <p>All changes to a style will be reflected on all elements it is applied as long as the element's property value matches what was in the style before the change.</p>

      <h2>Syncing Styles with Elements</h2>
      <p>Sometimes a global style and an element may fall out of sync. This occurs when the style's properties do not match the elements properties one-to-one. Out of sync styles are displayed in the Quick Styles tool with the words "(modified)" next to them when you have elements selected.</p>
      <img src="images/quick-styles-modified.png" class="img-quick-styles-modified">
      <p>In the event you want to fully re-apply a global style's properties onto an element you can hit the refresh button (circular arrow) next to the style's name. This will apply all the style properties to the selected elements overwriting the values on the elements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="library">
      <h1>Library</h1>
      <p>The library contains all assets and components in your Macaw project. It can be displayed by clicking the <strong class="btn">Library</strong> button in the top right section of the application.</p>

      <p>The library interface has a preview area that will display the current selected item, an import button for importing images (See "Images" section up above), a search bar for quickly finding items in your project and the item list. The item list is separated into two groups. "Components" and "Project". The "Components" folder contains all components created within the project. The "Project" folder contains all the images that have been imported into your project.</p>
      <img src="images/library-interface.png" class="img-library-interface">

      <h2>Previewing Items in Library</h2>
      <p>To Preview any item in the library click on the item to select it. On selection the preview window at the top of the library will display what the item looks like. This works for both components and images.</p>

      <h2>Placing Library Items on the Canvas</h2>
      <p>Any item in your project's library can be added in the canvas by dragging the item from the library list, moving it onto the canvas where you want it and releasing your mouse button. On drag a preview box will be displayed showing you the dimensions of the item you are placing. The newly placed item will be added on the canvas and placed inside any container that currently has focus. See <a href="#diving-containers">&quot;Diving into Containers&quot;</a> for more info.</p>

      <h2>Deleting Items</h2>
      <p>Library items can be removed at any time by clicking on the <strong class="btn">Trashcan</strong> icon for any item. On click you will be prompted to confirm that you would like to delete the selected item. IMPORTANT: This action cannot be undone. Tread carefully.</p>

    <section id="pages">
      <h1>Pages</h1>
      <p>Macaw allows you to create an entire website inside the application. You can add as many pages as you need to your project. It also allows you to duplicate existing pages for easy page generation.</p>

      <h2>Page Menu</h2>
      <p>The &quot;Page Menu&quot; is where you can manage your pages as well as open up existing pages for editing. It is located in the upper left corner of the application. The menu contains a list of all pages currently in your project. When you mouse over each page additional buttons appear for duplicating the page and deleting the page.</p>
      <img src="images/pages-menu.png" class="img-pages-menu">

      <h2>Navigating to Pages</h2>
      <p>Navigating to or opening a page can be done by opening the page menu and clicking on the page. This will open a new tab in Macaw for the page (if one is not already open for the selected page).</p>

      <h2>Adding Pages</h2>
      <p>To add a page, open the page menu and click the new page button. You can also create a new page by going to <strong class="cmd">File > New Page</strong> or you can use the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key osx">⌘+N</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+N</strong>. The app will ask you to provide a name for the new page. As long as the new page's name does not conflict with an existing page in your project, Macaw will create the new page.</p>

      <h2>Setting Page Properties</h2>
      <p>You can set a page's title using the "Page Title" palette which is visible when no elements are selected. This title will be inserted into the HTML on publish. If no page title is entered in this palette, the page name will be used when publishing.</p>
      <img src="images/pages-title.png" class="img-pages-title">

      <h2>Renaming Pages</h2>
      <p>You can rename any page by opening the "Page Menu" and double clicking on the page's name you wish to rename. This will allow you to type a new name. Once you have finished typing you can click anywhere outside the name or hit the <strong class="key">Return</strong> key to commit the change.</p>
      <img src="images/pages-rename.png" class="img-pages-rename">

      <h2>Duplicating Pages</h2>
      <p>Any page in your project can be duplicated by opening the "Page Menu" and clicking the duplicate (icon) that is visible when you mouse over the page in the page list. This will create an exact copy of the original page and all its data. The name of the duplicated page will be the name of the original page with "copy" appended to the end.</p>

      <h2>Deleting Pages</h2>
      <p>You can delete a page from your project by opening the "Page Menu" and clicking the trashcan (icon) that is visible when you mouse over the page in the page list. When deleting a page Macaw will prompt you to confirm that you want to delete the selected page. IMPORTANT: This action cannot be undone.</p>

      <h2>Publishing</h2>
      <p>Macaw by default will publish each page with its own corresponding CSS file. You can also tell Macaw to consolidate styles across pages into a single CSS file by enabling the "Consolidate Page Styles" in the Publish Settings dialog.</p>

      <p>You can publish your project in Macaw at any time using <strong class="cmd">File > Publish</strong> or hitting <strong class="key osx">⌘+P</strong> <strong class="key win">Ctrl+P</strong>. On publish Macaw will generate the necessary HTML, CSS, Images and JavaScript files for your project. It will place all published files in a directory next to your .mcw file in the file system. The files that Macaw generates depends on which publish settings you have enabled.</p>

      <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Macaw will generate a new folder with the same name as your .mcw file when publishing. It will place all published files into this directory. On every publish it will clean out the directory, so be sure not to place important files in it.</p>

      <h2>Publish Settings</h2>
      <p>You can control all of the publish settings using the Publish Settings Dialog. This dialog can be accessed by going to <strong class="cmd">File > Publish Settings</strong> or using the keyboard shortcut <strong class="key osx">Shift+⌘+P</strong> <strong class="key win">Shift+Ctrl+P</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Pages</h3>
      <p>The "Pages" section of the Publish Settings dialog allows you to control how Macaw handles the different pages in your project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The page list</strong> allows you to set which pages in your project will be published.</li>
        <li><strong>Consolidate Page Styles</strong> determines if Macaw will publish a CSS file for each page or if it will merge all styles into a single CSS file.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Head &amp; Tail</h3>
      <p>The "Head &amp; Tail" section of the publish settings dialog allows you to add code to include in the HEAD tag or the bottom of your BODY tag. Any code you add will be added to all pages. This is where you can add code for things like Google Analytics.</p>

      <h3>Styles</h3>
      <p>The "Styles" section makes available options for how Macaw should export your CSS.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consolidate Styles</strong> - Uses a powerful algorithm to consolidate styles based on the relationships existing between elements. It relies heavily on well-named elements and can generate far superior code when turned on.</li>
        <li><strong>Shorthand Properties</strong> - Allows similar properties to be shorthanded. For example, border-width: 10px; border-style: solid; border-color: #000; would be shorthanded to border: 10px solid #000;.</li>
        <li><strong>Tag Selectors</strong> - Allows Macaw to use tags as selectors instead of just class names. This can help write more consolidated styles but may also result in overpowered selectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Selectors</strong> - Enables :first and :last selectors. This is an experimental feature, which can cause unwanted side effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Trim Whitespace</strong> - Trims whitespace characters from CSS files, which may be desirable if bandwidth is an issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Browser Prefixes</strong> - Adds browser specific prefixes for properties like linear-gradient.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Units</h3>
      <p>The "Units" section allows you to have Macaw convert units for fonts and geometry on publish. This allows you to design with more intuitive units and let Macaw handle all the conversions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Font Size</strong> determines which unit Macaw will convert all font sizes to on publish.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry</strong> determines which unit Macaw will convert all pixel-based geometry values (width, height, etc) to on publish.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Grid</h3>
      <p>The "Grid" section allows you to determine if Macaw should generate a grid CSS file when published..</p>
      <img src="images/publishing-grid.png" class="img-publishing-grid">
      
      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>The "Images" section lets you determine if Macaw should generate optimized images when publishing. This is required in order to publish retina cropped images.</p>

      <h2>Preview Window</h2>
      <p>Macaw provides a built in preview window for viewing your published design. Within this window you can view all pages in your design, view the outputted code, etc. This window is just like a browser window so you can click on links you have placed in your design as well.</p>
      <img src="images/publishing-preview.png" class="img-publishing-preview">

      <p>The interface buttons from left to right are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Back/Forward</strong> buttons allow you to move forward or back to different pages you have viewed.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Address Bar</strong> displays your local IP address to be used for Remote Preview, the current page you are viewing and a page menu for moving to other pages in your project.</li>
        <li>The <strong>View Rendered Page</strong> button toggles the view to display the current page as it will be rendered in the browser (this is the default view).</li>
        <li>The <strong>View HTML</strong> button toggles the view to display the current page's generated HTML.</li>
        <li>The <strong>View CSS</strong> button toggles the view to display the current page's generated CSS.</li>
        <li>The <strong>View JavaScript</strong> button toggles the view to display the current page's JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The <strong>View in Finder</strong> button opens your current project in your native OS file explorer window.</li>
        <li>The <strong>View in Browser</strong> button opens the current page in your default browser.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Remote Preview</h2>
      <p>The Remote Preview features allows you to view your published design on other devices (mobile devices, other computers, etc) instantly. It also pushes all updates to each of your devices every time you publish. The only requirement is that all devices must be on the same local network.</p>

      <p>To view your design on other devices all you need to do is use another device to navigate to the address in the Address Bar of your preview window. This will load your project up just like a normal webpage. Anytime you make a change and publish your project your device will refresh to display the changes automatically.</p>

      <p>This feature is enabled whenever you publish your project and the Preview Window is open.</p>
